# Hey, Pepita! bot
An bot for Telegram that everyday sends you the latest message of good morning from @pepitaofc

### What was it? :thought_balloon:
There's a brazilian funk trans singer called Pepita, that makes stories at Instagram ([@pepita](https://www.instagram.com/pepita/)) everyday with motivational good-morning messages.
But, even though I'm brazilian, I'm currently living in Lisbon, so I wake up 4 hours ahead from everyone in Brazil. And I really would like to receive, everyday, when I wake up, a good-morning message from Pepita.
So I thought: "I'm gonna make a bot that stores the good morning messages and will send them to me as soon as I ask through Telegram!"
And I did it! Unfortunately, I couldn't get Instagram stories, so I did with Pepita's Twitter ([@pepitaofc](https://twitter.com/pepitaofc)).

### Is it published? How to use it? :arrow_forward:
I'm really looking forward to publish this one somewhere, but I still couldn't find a place :confused: I'll let you know when it's ready to use!
(And if you know a place, let me know, please! :pray:)
